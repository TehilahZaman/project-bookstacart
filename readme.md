  <summary> Challenges and Key Take Aways </summary>
  I found adding the search features for users to be the most exciting part of the project. It was something new and I enjoyed the challenge of figuring out how to implement exactly what I wanted. 
  Consuming the Google API and learning how to implrement referencing data were my biggest challenges during this project. I learned a lot pushing myself to do new things and take on the harder tasks, and I enjoyed building Bookstacart.
